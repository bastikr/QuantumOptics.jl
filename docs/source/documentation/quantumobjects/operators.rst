Operators
=========

Operators can be defined as linear maps from one Hilbert space to another. However, equivalently to states, operators in **QuantumOptics.jl** are interpreted as coefficients of an abstract operator in respect to one or more generally two, possibly distinct :ref:`bases <section-bases>`. For a certain choice of bases :math:`\{|u_i\rangle\}_i` and :math:`\{|v_j\rangle\}_j` an abstract operator :math:`A` has the coefficients :math:`A_{ij}` which are connected by the relation

.. math::

    A =  \sum_{ij} A_{ij} | u_i \rangle \langle v_j |

For this reason all operators define a left hand as well as a right hand basis::

    type MyOperator <: Operator
        basis_l::Basis
        basis_r::Basis
        ...
    end

For performance reasons there are several different implementations of operators in **QuantumOptics.jl**, all inheriting from the abstract :jl:abstract:`Operator` type:

* :ref:`subsection-denseoperators`
* :ref:`subsection-sparseoperators`
* :ref:`subsection-lazyoperators`

They have the same interface and can in most cases be used interchangeably, e.g. they can be combined using arithmetic functions \*, /, +, -::

    b = SpinBasis(1//2)
    sx = sigmax(b)
    sy = sigmay(b)
    sx + sy
    sx * sy

Additionally, the following functions are implemented for all types of operators, if possible:

* :jl:func:`dagger`
* :jl:func:`identityoperator`
* :jl:func:`trace`
* :jl:func:`normalize`
* :jl:func:`normalize!`
* :jl:func:`expect`
* :jl:func:`variance`
* :jl:func:`tensor`
* :jl:func:`permutesystems`
* :jl:func:`embed`
* :jl:func:`ptrace`
* :jl:func:`expm`

Conversion from one type of operator to another is also provided. I.e. to obtain a :jl:type:`DenseOperators` or :jl:type:`SparseOperator` use the :jl:func:`full` and :jl:func:`sparse` functions, respectively.


.. _subsection-denseoperators:

Dense operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:jl:type:`DenseOperator` is the default type used for density operators. I.e. creating an operator by using the tensor product of a ket and a bra state results in a :jl:type:`DenseOperator`. It is implemented as::

    type DenseOperator <: Operator
        basis_l::Basis
        basis_r::Basis
        data::Matrix{Complex128}
    end

where the data is stored as complex (dense) matrix in the ``data`` field.

The :jl:func:`full(::Operator)` function can be used to convert other types of operators to dense operators.


.. _subsection-sparseoperators:

Sparse operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:jl:type:`SparseOperator` is the default type used in **QuantumOptics.jl**. The reason is that in many quantum systems the Hamiltonians and jump operators in respect to the commonly used bases are sparse. They are implemented as::

    type SparseOperator <: Operator
        basis_l::Basis
        basis_r::Basis
        data::SparseMatrixCSC{Complex128}
    end

To convert other operators to sparse operators the :jl:func:`sparse(::Operator)` function can be used.


.. _subsection-lazyoperators:

Lazy operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Lazy operators allow delayed evaluation of certain operations. This is useful when combining two operators is numerically expensive but separate multiplication with states is relatively cheap. A nice example is the :jl:type:`FFTOperator` implemented for particles. It allows using a fast fourier transformation to convert a state from real space to momentum space, applying a diagonal operator and converting it back. Doing this in operator notation is only fast if the the order of operations is :math:`\mathrm{IFFT}*(D*(\mathrm{FFT}*\psi))`. To create a Hamiltonian that uses this calculation order, lazy evaluation is needed::

    xmin = -5
    xmax = 5
    Npoints = 100
    b_position = PositionBasis(xmin, xmax, Npoints)
    b_momentum = MomentumBasis(b_position)

    p = momentum(b_momentum)
    x = position(b_position)

    Tpx = particle.FFTOperator(b_momentum, b_position);

    H = LazyProduct(dagger(Txp), p^2/2, Tpx) + x^2

In this case the Hamiltonian :math:`H` is a lazy sum of the kinetic term :math:`p^2/2` and the potential term :math:`x^2` where the kinetic term is the lazy product mentioned before. In the end this results in a speed up from :math:`O(N^2)` to :math:`O(N \log N)`.

There are currently three different concrete implementations:

* :jl:type:`LazyTensor`
* :jl:type:`LazySum`
* :jl:type:`LazyProduct`
