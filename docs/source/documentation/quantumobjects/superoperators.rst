Super-operators
===============

Let's now consider mappings from the space of mappings :math:`\mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}` to itself, i.e. :math:`(\mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{H} \rightarrow \mathcal{H})`. In operator notation we also call these objects *super-operators*. With the operators :math:`A,B` and the super-operator :math:`S` the basis independent expression is denoted by

.. math::

    A = S B

In contrast, for the basis specific version we have to choose two possibly different bases for A which we denote as :math:`\{|u\rangle\}` and :math:`\{|v\rangle\}` and additionally two, also possibly different bases for B, :math:`\{|m\rangle\}` and :math:`\{|n\rangle\}`.

.. math::

    A &= \sum_{uv} A_{uv} |v \rangle \langle u|
    \\
    B &= \sum_{mn} B_{mn} |n \rangle \langle m|
    \\
    S &= \sum_{uvmn} S_{uvmn} |v \rangle \langle u| \otimes
                              |n \rangle \langle m|

The coefficients are then connected by

.. math::

    A_{uv} = \sum_{mn} S_{uvmn} B_{mn}

The implementation of super-operators in **QuantumOptics.jl** therefore has to know about four, possibly different, bases. The two basis choices for the codomain (output) are stored in the ``basis_l`` field and the two basis choices for the domain (input) are stored in the ``basis_r`` field. At the moment there are two concrete super-operator types implemented, a dense version :jl:type:`DenseSuperOperator` and a sparse version :jl:type:`SparseSuperOperator`, both inheriting from the abstract :jl:abstract:`SuperOperator` type.

Besides the expected algebraic operations there are a few additional functions that help creating and working with super-operators:

* :jl:func:`spre`
* :jl:func:`spost`
* :jl:func:`liouvillian`
* :jl:func:`expm`
